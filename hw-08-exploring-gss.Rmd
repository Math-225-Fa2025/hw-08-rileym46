The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes.
Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.
In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.
Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

In this assignment we analyze data from the 2016 GSS, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults.[^hw-08-exploring-gss-1]

# Getting started

Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your homework repo, clone it in Posit Cloud and open the R Markdown document.
Knit the document to make sure it compiles without errors.

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.
Update the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.
Then, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.
If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dsbox/tidymodels")
library(tidyverse)
library(dsbox)
library(parsnip)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `gss16`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?gss16` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `gss16`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/gss16.html).

# Exercises

## Part 1: Harassment at work

In 2016, the GSS added a new question on harassment at work.
The question is phrased as the following.

> *Over the past five years, have you been harassed by your superiors or co-workers at your job, for example, have you experienced any bullying, physical or psychological abuse?*

Answers to this question are stored in the `harass5` variable in our dataset.

1.  What are the possible responses to this question and how many respondents chose each of these answers?

```{r yes-no-NA}
gss16 %>%
  count(harass5)
```
`The possible answers are yes, no, and does not apply. 237 people answered yes. 1136 answered no. 96 people answered "Does not apply (i do not have a job/superior/co-worker". The sample size is 2867, so we know that 1398 people did not answer (NA).`

2.  What percent of the respondents for whom this question is applicable\
    (i.e. excluding `NA`s and `Does not apply`s) have been harassed by their superiors or co-workers at their job.
    
    `20.86% of people have been harassed by their superior or co-workers. That means that 79.14% of people has NOT been harassed by their superiors or co-workers.`

## Part 2: Time spent on email

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents how many hours and minutes they spend on email weekly.
The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables.
For example, if the response is 2.5 hrs, this would be recorded as `emailhr = 2` and `emailmin = 30`.

3.  Create a new variable called `email` that combines these two variables to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

```{r email}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(email = ((emailhr * 60) + emailmin))
```
  
4.  Visualize the distribution of this new variable.
    Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly.
    Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly?
    Why?
    
```{r email-hist}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = email)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 60) +
  labs(x = "Time spent on email (in minutes)")

summary(gss16$email)
```

`The mean is 416.8 minutes. The median is 120.0. The median is a better measure of how often an American spend on email. The mean could be offset by outliers - people who spend a much larger or smaller amount of time emailing.`


5.  Create another new variable, `snap_insta` that is coded as "Yes" if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and "No" if not.
    If the recorded value was `NA` for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be `NA`.
    
```{r snap-insta}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(snap_insta = ifelse(
  !is.na(gss16$snapchat) & gss16$snapchat == "Yes" | 
  !is.na(gss16$instagrm) & gss16$instagrm == "Yes", 
  "Yes", 
  ifelse(
    is.na(gss16$snapchat) & is.na(gss16$instagrm), 
    NA, 
    "No"
  )
  )
)
```

6.  Calculate the percentage of Yes's for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding `NA`s.
```{r percents}
yes_snap_insta <- sum(gss16$snap_insta == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE)
print(yes_snap_insta)
no_snap_insta <- sum(gss16$snap_insta == "No", na.rm = TRUE)
print(no_snap_insta)
```
`1372 people voted either yes or no in using either Snapchat or Instagram. That means that 37.46% use Snapchat or Instagram. 62.54% do not.`

7.  What are the possible responses to the question *Last week were you working full time, part time, going to school, keeping house, or what?* and how many respondents chose each of these answers?
    Note that this information is stored in the `wrkstat` variable.
```{r count}
gss16 %>%
  count(wrkstat)
```

8.  Fit a model predicting `email` (number of minutes per week spent on email) from `educ` (number of years of education), `wrkstat`, and `snap_insta`.
    Interpret the slopes for each of these variables.
```{r logical}
email_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(email ~ educ  + wrkstat + snap_insta, data = gss16)
tidy(email_fit)
```
`The intercept is -229.74, which means that when every other variable is 0, the average number of emails sent is -229.74. As the number of time educated increases, the number of emails sent increases by 29.63 on average. The work status also affects how many emails are sent. Those who are working full time are sending a lot more emails than other (366.84, on average). People who are students or not working are sending less emails (-123.81 and -73.71, respectively).` 

9.  Create a predicted values vs. residuals plot for this model.
    Are there any issues with the model?
    If yes, describe them.
```{r plot}
email_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(email ~ educ  + wrkstat + snap_insta, data = gss16)

email_fit_avg <- augment(email_fit$fit)

email_fit_avg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red", lty = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Values vs. Residuals Plot",
       x = "Predicted Values",
       y = "Residuals"
  )
```
`There are issues with the model. It does not look scattered enough. There is still a clear descending line and clusters.`

## Part 3: Political views and science research

The 2016 GSS also asked respondents whether they think of themselves as liberal or conservative (`polviews`) and whether they think science research is necessary and should be supported by the federal government (`advfront`).

-   The question on science research is worded as follows:

> Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.

And possible responses to this question are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree, Don't know, No answer, Not applicable.

-   The question on political views is worded as follows:

> We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
> I'm going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal--point 1--to extremely conservative--point 7.
> Where would you place yourself on this scale?

```{marginfigure}
**Note:** The levels of this variables are spelled inconsistently: "Extremely liberal" vs. "Extrmly conservative". Since this is the spelling that shows up in the data, you need to make sure this is how you spell the levels in your code.
```

And possible responses to this question are Extremely liberal, Liberal, Slightly liberal, Moderate, Slghtly conservative, Conservative, Extrmly conservative.
Responses that were originally Don't know, No answer and Not applicable are already mapped to `NA`s upon data import.

10. In a new variable, recode `advfront` such that Strongly Agree and Agree are mapped to `"Yes"`, and Disagree and Strongly disagree are mapped to `"No"`.
    The remaining levels can be left as is.
    Don't overwrite the existing `advfront`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.

```{r adv_edit}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(adv_edit = case_when(
  advfront %in% c("Strongly Agree", "Agree") ~ "Yes",
  advfront %in% c("Disagree", "Strongly disagree") ~ "No",
  TRUE ~ advfront 
  )
)
gss16$adv_edit <- as.factor(gss16$adv_edit)
```

11. In a new variable, recode `polviews` such that Extremely liberal, Liberal, and Slightly liberal, are mapped to `"Liberal"`, and Slghtly conservative, Conservative, and Extrmly conservative disagree are mapped to `"Conservative"`.
    The remaining levels can be left as is.
    Make sure that the levels are in a reasonable order.
    Don't overwrite the existing `polviews`, instead pick a different, informative name for your new variable.

```{r polviews_edit}
gss16 <- gss16 %>%
  mutate(polviews_edit = case_when(
  polviews %in% c("Extremely liberal", "Liberal", "Slightly liberal") ~ "Liberal",
  polviews %in% c("Slghtly conservative", "Conservative", "Extrmly conservative") ~ "Conservative",
  TRUE ~ polviews 
  )
)
gss16$polviews_edit <- as.factor(gss16$polviews_edit)
```

12. Create a visualization that displays the relationship between these two new variables and interpret it.

```{r graph-polviews}
gss16 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = polviews_edit, color = adv_edit, fill = adv_edit)) +
  geom_bar()+
  labs(
    title = "Political Views vs Science Research",
    x = "Political Views",
    y = "Count",
    color = "Scientific Views",
    fill = "Scientific Views"
  )
```
`From this graph, we can see how political views tend to align with the belief that science research is necessary and should be supported by the federal government. People that are conservative tend to vote no. People that are liberal tend to vote yes. Those that are moderate answered more NA than other columns, but also leaned towards yes.`
